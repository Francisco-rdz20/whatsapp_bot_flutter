# Whatsapp bot flutter Web

Demo of web app built using Whatsapp_bot_flutter


## Setup WhatsappWeb

Run a puppeteer server and get wsUrl

or we can use [browserless](https://cloud.browserless.io/account/) for running chrome instances and use those to connect with whatsapp

To use browserless for testing, create a free account there and get `API_TOKEN` from there

then in example app use this wsUrl to connect : `wss://chrome.browserless.io?token=API_TOKEN`
